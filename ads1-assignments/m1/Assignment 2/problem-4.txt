This sequqnece is possible in the case of a weighted quick union with path compression as it is the starting
state of the array and no unions have been made.


7 3 8 3 4 5 6 8 8 1
This is not valid because it violates the rule of the weighted quick union that the larger tree
shoould always be the root node/ parent for a shorter tree.


6 3 8 0 4 5 6 9 8 1
This is not valid because it violates the rule of the weighted quick union that the larger tree
shoould always be the root node/ parent for a shorter tree.


0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
This sequqnece is possible in the case of a weighted quick union with path compression.
it is because 0 is the only root node in this case with size 10 and almost a flattened tree.


9 6 2 6 1 4 5 8 8 9
This is not valid because it violates the rule of the weighted quick union that the larger tree
shoould always be the root node/ parent for a shorter tree. Plus the tree is circular meaning that all the elements 
cannot be accesed with the root node.

This is not possible because it will lead to a circular loop and we cannot get
the weighted quick union with path compression.
