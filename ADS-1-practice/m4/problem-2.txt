Question :
Suppose that a client performs an intermixed sequence of (stack) push and pop operations. The push operations put the integers 0 through 9 in order onto the stack; the pop operations print out the return values. Which of the following sequence(s) could not occur?

Solution :

4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5
Possible
4 6 8 7 5 3 2 9 0 1
Not Possible, because 0 cannot be removed without popping 1.
2 5 6 7 4 8 9 3 1 0 
Possible
4 3 2 1 0 5 6 7 8 9
Possible
1 2 3 4 5 6 9 8 7 0 
Possible
0 4 6 5 3 8 1 7 2 9
Not Possible, because 1 cannot be popped without popping 2.
1 4 7 9 8 6 5 3 0 2
Not Possible, because 0 cannot be popped without popping 2.
2 1 4 3 6 5 8 7 9 0
Possible
