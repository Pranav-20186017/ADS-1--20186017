Suppose that a client performs an intermixed sequence of (queue) enqueue and dequeue operations. The enqueue operations put the integers 0 through 9 in order onto the queue; the dequeue operations print out the return value. Which of the following sequence(s) could not occur?
(a) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
(b) 4 6 8 7 5 3 2 9 0 1 
(c) 2 5 6 7 4 8 9 3 1 0
(d) 4 3 2 1 0 5 6 7 8 9


(a) This is feasible as each of the element(s) is enqueued first and is then dequeued imeediately

(b) This is not possible since the enqueue operations have been perfromed till 4 before a dequeue operation and hence the first dequeue element should be 0 but it is given as 4 instead

(c) This is not possible since the enqueue operations have been perfromed till 2 before a dequeue operation and hence the first dequeue element should be 0 but it is given as 2 instead

(d)  This is not possible since the enqueue operations have been perfromed till 4 before a dequeue operation and hence the first dequeue element should be 0 but it is given as 4 instead
