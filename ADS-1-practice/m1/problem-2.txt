There are four methods that are discussed, namely:

1. Quick find
2. QUick union
3. Weighted Quick Union
4. Weighted Quick Union path compression

Out of these four the Weighted Quick Union path compression is the fastest that is because of the following reasons

1. It has a time complexity of O(log * N)
2. It can process a data set as large as 2 to the power of 65,536 in 6 seconds
3. It flattens the tree making it much faster to access elements.
