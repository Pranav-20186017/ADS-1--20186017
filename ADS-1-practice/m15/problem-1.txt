Question:
Which of the symbol-table implementations in this section would you use for an application that does 10^6 put() operations and 10^3 get() operations, randomly intermixed?

Answer:
	Using Symbol Table implementation using Binary Search Tree because it is simply faster ergo has less time complexity.
In Linked List:
	Complexity for put() : O(N)
	Complexity for get() : O(N)

In Binary Search Tree:
	Complexity for put() : O(logN)
	Complexity for get() : O(logN)

For larger operations like 10^6 and 10^3 it would be efficient of using Binary Search Tree to implement Symbol Table.
